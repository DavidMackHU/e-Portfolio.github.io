        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="HeadShot.png" alt="Head Shot">
        <p>I’m a sophomore at Howard University majoring in Computer Science. Originally from Durham, North Carolina, I was drawn to Computer Science because of its endless possibilities and creative potential. From a young age, I was exposed to coding, which sparked my passion for creating and problem-solving. In high school, I deepened my skills through coding courses, and today, I’m excited about pursuing opportunities in quantitative trading and web design.

            Outside of academics, I enjoy fishing on the weekends, hanging out with friends, and staying active by running and working out. When I’m not outdoors, I’m often engrossed in thought-provoking books like The 48 Laws of Power. I’m also working on launching a web design company right here on Howard’s campus, combining my entrepreneurial spirit with my technical expertise.
            
            I’ve had the privilege of giving back to my community through internships in my hometown and earning the rank of Eagle Scout, which taught me the value of persistence and resilience. I’ve also received an academic scholarship and an internship through my church, which I’m deeply proud of.
            
            Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to become the CEO of my own web design company while leveraging quantitative trading as a source of passive income. Through hard work and determination, I’m committed to making my dreams a reality and leaving a positive impact wherever I go.</p>
